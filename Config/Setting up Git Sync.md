So, I have set up microvault on my GitHub Desktop and published the repo to my GitHub Account. I've installed, enabled, and configured Obsidian Git in this vault, set up hotkeys for pull and push (Shift - CMD/ALT > for push, Shift - CMD/ALT < for pull).

Now, I'm testing a push... it seems to work!

Once more, just for fun.

One issue, Instead of automatically committing to main, I'm pushing to the repo. I may actually like this setup. When I finish my changes and then commit to main via GitHub Desktop. The jury's still out on that.
