So, I have set up microvault on my GitHub Desktop and published the repo to my GitHub Account. I've installed, enabled, and configured Obsidian Git in this vault, set up hotkeys for pull and push (Shift - CMD/ALT > for push, Shift - CMD/ALT < for pull).

Now, I'm testing a push... it seems to work!

Once more, just for fun.

One issue, Instead of automatically committing to main, I'm pushing to the repo. I may actually like this setup. When I finish my changes and then commit to main via GitHub Desktop. The jury's still out on that.

I know have GitHub Desktop insytalled on my CSF laptop and the cloned repo set up. I'm currently appending this text to the page and am about to push it back to GitHub with a hotkey, that I think should have written to this vault. Confirming that now. Yes, here it's (SHIFT+ CTRL > to push>) but I get that Git cannot run the command. Maybe I have to have GitHub Desktop running. But my changes seem to be coming over to the repo, so I should be able to commit them to main.
