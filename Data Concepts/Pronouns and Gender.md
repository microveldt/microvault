Sara and I are working through feedback from the High School to College transition team on CSF deals with "preferred pronouns" and gender that will affect Salesforce. This comes out of our work on the Transition Services enrollment form.  
  
We may very well get to a place where Sara needs to create a new custom TEXT field, Pronouns__c. This would be updated with the values from PICKLIST field, Preferred_pronoun__c. Gender__c would remain a text field.  
  
To the extent that we'd need to group this data for reporting, Sara will likely use a bucket field.  
  
This comes from the direction that education best practices in recognizing students' identities is taking. If we end up not making these changes now, we are definitely going to be making them down the line.
